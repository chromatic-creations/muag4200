       <h3>Project topic: <em>Little Nightmares II</em> (focus on the psychology of the horror genre and the implication of the child protagonist)</h3>
    </center>
   <br> <em>Little Nightmares II</em> is game produced by Tarsier Studios as a prequel to their previous game in the series <em>Little Nightmares</em> that follows the 
    journey of a small boy known as Mono as he adventures through a desolate place known as The Pale City. In contrast to the previous game, which had only a single protagonist, 
    early in his journey Mono gains the trust and companionship of another child known as Six, non-playable character who provides aid to Mono in his journey. Notably, Six 
    was the protagonist of the previous publication in this series and begins the journey without her iconic yellow raincoat, finding it amongst the ruins of the city and 
    firmly establishing the plot of <em>Little Nightmares II</em> as taking place prior to the events of the first game.</br>
