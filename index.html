       <h3>Doomed by the Narrative: <em>Little Nightmares II</em> and Encountering a Warped Reflection</h3>
    </center>
   <br> <em>Little Nightmares II</em> is game produced by Tarsier Studios as a prequel to their previous game in the series <em>Little Nightmares</em> that follows the 
    journey of a small boy known as Mono as he adventures through a desolate place known as The Pale City. In contrast to the previous game, which had only a single protagonist, 
    early in his journey Mono gains the trust and companionship of another child known as Six, non-playable character who provides aid to Mono in his journey. Notably, Six 
    was the protagonist of the previous publication in this series and begins the journey without her iconic yellow raincoat, finding it amongst the ruins of the city and 
    firmly establishing the plot of <em>Little Nightmares II</em> as taking place prior to the events of the first game.</br>

    Throughout the game, Mono and Six not only must avoid the treacherous obstacles throughout the various stages of the game, but Mono is haunted by visions of the Thin Man, 
    a being that appears to him through the screen of televisions scattered throughout the city. Disturbing figures litter the city staring into these staticing screens, faces 
    warped beyond recognition, silent and still unless their connection is disturbed — at which point they become hostile towards the children.
    </br>
    <br>
    A prominent theme throughout <em>Little Nightmares II</em> that has been carried over from the first game is that the greatest threat to the protagonist and his companion comes 
    from the adults in the game — all of whom are characterized by grotesque, misshapen forms (whether that be too long limbs or missing parts of faces or large bodies). Most notably 
    all of the adults and the environments in the game outsize Mono and Six by a significant degree. These children are not simply smaller than the adults, they're <em>tiny</em> 
    by comparison. Easily crushed within the hands of their tormentors. It also makes navigating the environments all that more complicated, but both children prove quite clever 
    in the ways they ultimately use their environment to their advantage.

    <br>
    Both in the contrast of design and in the narrative, the adults in the game form a mirror as referenced in Jacques Lacan's work that the protagonist define themselves in opposition 
    to. This is especially true of the relationship between Mono and the Thin Man, like looking into a fun house mirror. Throughout the game, Mono is drawn to the televisions scattered 
    around the city, even demonstrating an unique ability to manipulate and teleport through them — an ability possessed also by the Thin Man himself. Ultimately, the Thin Man is Mono's 
    nightmare, a vision of an adult he desparately wishes not to be. On the other hand, Mono sees a more positive reflection of himself in Six. Early in the game, they meet in the woods 
    outside of the Pale City and learn to work together and trust each other in order to defeat The Hunter who is after them. In Six, Mono sees much of himself, a lonely child doing what 
    it takes to survive in a hostile environment. Six, presumably, sees much of the same when she begins to trust Mono rather than sticking it out on her own. Mono's identity is defined 
    for the player by two contrasting mirrors — the monsterous, in opposition, and the familiar, in comparison. 
    </br>
    <br>
    These mirrors are reinforced through the concept of hailing, or "interpellation", the calling of an individual that — through recognition of the call — said individual "becomes 
    the subject" (Althusser). This hailing process is both explicit and implicit through the game's mechanics. To facilitate collaboration between the player and their companion, a 
    method of explicit hailing is implemented by which Mono can call to Six, which the player can use encourage her to come towards him or to interact with game objects in order to 
    help him. An example of this can be seen below:

    </center>
    <br>
    Notably, these calls are the only recognizable words used in the game. In this audio, you can hear the explicit "hey" noise that Mono makes. On occasion, Six can also be 
    heard calling back to Mono in a similar degree, typically right before she helps him across a long jump or to point out game elements to help the player solve the puzzle. This 
    back-and-forth establishes these characters relation to each other and reinforces their positive relationship as mirrors. This hailing helps establish for the player their 
    companionship and thus keeps the player invested in the well being of both Mono and Six, which becomes helpful later in the game where Mono must rescue Six at multiple points 
    rather than simply continuing on his own.
    </br>
    <br>
    On the opposing end, the hailing between the Thin Man and Mono is more implicit. Rather than the call and response Mono and Six establish, Mono is inexplicably and uncontrollably 
    drawn to the television sets scattered throughout the Pale City. In fact, this part of the gameplay functions more as a cutscene, with Mono's actions being out of the player's 
    control once he is drawn towards a TV. Typically, Six is able to draw him out before any harm comes to him and the player resumes control over the game, but the extended sequence 
    below demonstrates the connection between Mono and the Thin Man (warning for flickering lights).

    </center>
    <br>
    Here, you can see that even without out any outright cries, the TV (and, by extension, the Thin Man on the other side) is hailing to Mono via the flickering lights, the sudden 
    ringing  and static buzz, the way the rest of the screen dims to call both Mono and the player into the view on the TV. This sequence only ends once the door is reached and the 
    Thin Man is unleashed, allowing him to come to Mono's location. This hailing being both implicit and involuntary on the part of the player (and, seemingly, to Mono as well) 
    reinforces the Thin Man's position as a negative mirror. This connection is not one of choice, like Mono's relationship to Six, but one forced upon him and the player. The opposing 
    reflections of Six and the Thin Man are demonstrated even in the moment of her capture, where Six explicitly calls and reaches out to Mono but the Thin Man simply vanishes without 
    a trace and the room returns to normal.
    </br>
    <br>
    Interestingly, the Thin Man ultimately does not get Mono, but rather captures his other mirror, Six, leaving Mono well and truly alone until he encounters them both at the Signal 
    Tower — the location of the final boss fight of the game. Here, he finds Six alive but transformed into a monsterous form of herself, larger than life and transfixed by the sounds 
    of a music box. Much like the warped adults scattered throughout the city, she is kept calm by the music box and becomes aggressive when disturbed. In order to save her, Mono must 
    disturb the illusion of peace she has found within the traumatic experience she has gone through. After rescuing Six, the Signal Tower begins to collapse, and the two children run 
    quickly through it in their escape attempt. Like so many prior moments in the game, this escape attempt ends with a jump across a large gap where Six catches Mono in order to lift 
    him up onto stable ground. Unlike the prior attempts, Six chooses to release Mono in order to save herself, showing how her experience within the Signal Tower has broken the 
    strength of their relationship and her reflection of Mono as a positive mirror. Abandoned, Mono falls through the Signal Tower and becomes trapped in a room alone with a television 
    and a single chair.
    </br>
    <br>
    In the end, Mono encounters the Thin Man again within himself. The tragedy of what he has been through ultimately transforms him into the negative mirror he initially defined 
    himself in opposition of. Alone and betrayed, he gradually grows taller and longer into the now recognizable shape of the Thin Man, his face no longer obscured to the player.
    At the end of the cutscene, the camera draws back and the door closes, revealing the long hallway from Mono's visions, suggesting perhaps that this process is destined to repeat 
    itself, whether by means of a time loop or by similar children being drawn into the Signal Tower's trappings. Certainly, it confirms that Mono was already doomed from the start, 
    that the relationship between himself and his reflection was stronger than his own ability to escape it.
    </br>
    <br>
    From a wider perspective, <em>Little Nightmares II</em> in no way resembles any basic reality that we know of, but rather serves as simulacra which — being so isolated from the 
    reality we are familiar with — allows us to reflect on it's messages as it applies to our own world. Mono's journey from that perspective shows the ways social norms can shape 
    our identities. It reflects the way the harshness of the world can drive us to sharpen ourselves in response, to push away from impulses of kindness and empathy in order to survive 
    the trials and tribulations of a system designed to crush us. However, the message of <em>Little Nightmares II</em> is not that we, like Mono, are doomed to repeat the cycles of 
    violence. Rather, the tragic nature of his story and his world compels us to reflect on how we can be different. The world around Mono shaped his fate, and realizing how the world 
    around us shapes our lives can prompt us to question what parts of the world we would like to see changed in order to break the cycle.
