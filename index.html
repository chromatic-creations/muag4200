    Current ideas:
    <br>1. Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild <em>(focus on lore development, storytelling, engagement with semi-open world environment)</em></br>
    <br>2. Little Nightmares II <em>(focus on the psychology of the horror genre and the implication of the child protagonist)</em></br>
    <br>3. Little Big Planet 2 <em>(focus on creative freedom for the player and how that promotes game interaction)</em></br>
    <br>4. Any LEGO game <em>(focus on pop culture influence in the video game industry? accessible for replays)</em><br>
