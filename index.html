       <h3>Doomed by the Narrative: A reflection on <em>Little Nightmares II</em> and the child protagonist</h3>
    </center>
   <br> <em>Little Nightmares II</em> is game produced by Tarsier Studios as a prequel to their previous game in the series <em>Little Nightmares</em> that follows the 
    journey of a small boy known as Mono as he adventures through a desolate place known as The Pale City. In contrast to the previous game, which had only a single protagonist, 
    early in his journey Mono gains the trust and companionship of another child known as Six, non-playable character who provides aid to Mono in his journey. Notably, Six 
    was the protagonist of the previous publication in this series and begins the journey without her iconic yellow raincoat, finding it amongst the ruins of the city and 
    firmly establishing the plot of <em>Little Nightmares II</em> as taking place prior to the events of the first game.</br>

    Throughout the game, Mono and Six not only must avoid the treacherous obstacles throughout the various stages of the game, but Mono is haunted by visions of the Thin Man, 
    a being that appears to him through the screen of televisions scattered throughout the city. Disturbing figures litter the city staring into these staticing screens, faces 
    warped beyond recognition, silent and still unless their connection is disturbed — at which point they become hostile towards the children.
    </br>
    <br>
    A prominent theme throughout <em>Little Nightmares II</em> that has been carried over from the first game is that the greatest threat to the protagonist and his companion comes 
    from the adults in the game — all of whom are characterized by grotesque, misshapen forms (whether that be too long limbs or missing parts of faces or large bodies). Most notably 
    all of the adults and the environments in the game outsize Mono and Six by a significant degree. These children are not simply smaller than the adults, they're <em>tiny</em> 
    by comparison. Easily crushed within the hands of their tormentors. It also makes navigating the environments all that more complicated, but both children prove quite clever 
    in the ways they ultimately use their environment to their advantage.

    Both in the contrast of design and in the narrative, the adults in the game form a mirror as referenced in Jacques Lacan's work that the protagonist define themselves in opposition 
    to. This is especially true of the relationship between Mono and the Thin Man, like looking into a fun house mirror. Throughout the game, Mono is drawn to the televisions scattered 
    around the city, even demonstrating an unique ability to manipulate and teleport through them — an ability possessed also by the Thin Man himself. Ultimately, the Thin Man is Mono's 
    nightmare, a vision of an adult he desparately wishes not to be. On the other hand, Mono sees a more positive reflection of himself in Six. Early in the game, they meet in the woods 
    outside of the Pale City and learn to work together and trust each other in order to defeat The Hunter who is after them. In Six, Mono sees much of himself, a lonely child doing what 
    it takes to survive in a hostile environment. Six, presumably, sees much of the same when she begins to trust Mono rather than sticking it out on her own. Mono's identity is defined 
    for the player by two contrasting mirrors — the monsterous, in opposition, and the familiar, in comparison. 
    </br>
    <br>
    These mirrors are reinforced through the concept of hailing, or "interpellation", the calling of an individual that — through recognition of the call — said individual "becomes 
    the subject" (Althusser). This hailing process is both explicit and implicit through the game's mechanics. To facilitate collaboration between the player and their companion, a 
    method of explicit hailing is implemented by which Mono can call to Six, which can encourage her to come towards him or to interact with game objects in order to help him. An example 
    of this can be seen below:

    </center>
    <br>
    Notably, these calls to Six are the only recognizable words used in the game. In this audio, you can hear the explicit "hey" noise that Mono makes. On occasion, Six can also be 
    heard calling back to Mono in a similar degree, typically right before she helps him across a long jump or to point out game elements to help the player solve the puzzle. This 
    back-and-forth establishes these characters relation to each other and reinforces their positive relationship as mirrors.
